## Who are You?

We'll start with introductions and a bit of "getting to know you."

## Setting Expectations

First, we'll take some time out to discuss, as a group, the expectations we have for the semester. **We will use the results of this conversation to update the course syllabus**.

## Story Games

We'll spend some time telling stories; we'll use the Storymatic cards to kickstart our process.

**Rules: **

1. Pick two gold cards and two copper cards. The gold cards describe the character; the copper cards describe the lead-in for your story.

2. Do not kill your character.

#### StoryStorming

1. We will work in pairs. So, two of you will work together on one story. 

1. Take 5 minutes, and brainstorm as many possible story arcs as you can.

<img src="{{site.base}}/images/story-arc.jpg" width="500"/>
</div>

1. Take 5 minutes, and sketch (in four thumbnails) the story arc you want to use in your story. What other characters and events will be significant in your story?

1. Take 5 minutes, and flesh out the details of your story.

This whole process will take between 15-20 minutes. We'll then **mix up our groupings** and share our stories with each-other.
