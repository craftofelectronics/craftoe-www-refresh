A significant piece of class time will be given over to exhibiting our work. 

* Sharing our Work (60m)
* Exploring Mood (20m)
* Work Time (30m)

## Sharing our Work

We'll start the day by sharing our first works in Alice.

## Exploring Mood

Next, a brief introduction to the next assignment.

## Work Time

We'll close the period with some time to work on Wednesday's assignment. It is still a static construction in Alice, but having some time to discuss and brainstorm with classmates is valuable.
