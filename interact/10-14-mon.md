### Sharing

The first thing we want to do today is share the work that we did over the weekend developing characters, scenes, and narrative in HB.


### Discussion

We've discussed the story, but now we're making our own interpretation. What have we seen that gets at some of the essential themes we discussed, how do we want to approach them, etc.

In short, how will our animation convey the messages we want it to, and are we on track?

### Develop

Based on that discussion, I would like groups to spend some time, in pairs, working on development of scenes. 

We will likely shuffle groups at this point, so that we have someone from each production team involved, to help keep things on track.

### Homework

We have a short homework for Wednesday; check it out on the website.
