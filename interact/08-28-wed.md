We'll do three things today:

* StoryStorming (30m)
* Persuasion and Art (30m)
* Scenes in Alice (50m)

## StoryStorming

We'll run our StoryStorming process again; this gives us a chance to get to know each-other, be creative, and wake our minds up after lunch.

## Persuasion and Art

After sharing some of our storystorming results, we'll have a short discussion on the subject of art and persuasion. In particular, we'll be looking at one-panel political cartoons and propaganda art.

## Scenes in Alice

Finally, we'll close with a short exercise on the creation of static scenes in Alice. This will prepare you for your homework for next Monday.
