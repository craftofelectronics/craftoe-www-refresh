Today, we're going to spend some time pulling our short story apart, bringing storyboards together, and plotting our animation sequences.

So: lots of moving around, group interaction, and discussion. It's going to be chaotic, and by the end of the period, miracles will have occurred, and we'll have an amazing story that's ready for production!

I have embedded our documents in the webpage below. You can get links to them in Moodle.

## Characters

First, lets make sure we have the story for our characters clear.

## Storyboards

Then, lets make sure we understand the scenes we want to animate.

## Scenery

For each scene, we not only need characters and animation, but we need scenery. This is both visual and auditory.
