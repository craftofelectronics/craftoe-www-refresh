* In the Door: Your Reflections (20m)
* Introducing Alice (50m)

### In the Door: Your Reflections

**In the Door** activities are things you should do as you arrive. You do not need to wait for me to get them started.

As you come into the classroom, form into groups of 3-5 people (spontaneously), and share some of your reflections and thoughts from the TED talk we watched.

* What were your initial reactions to the story that Chimamanda shared?
* How are those similar or different from your classmates? Why? Is it because of differences in your background? Something else entirely?
* Have you ever experienced or witnessed anything like Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's experiences in coming to study in the USA?

Your conversation may wander further afield, but those questions give you some starting points, perhaps. We'll come together as a group 

### Introducing Alice

Finally, we'll spend a little bit of time exploring the Alice programming environment, which we'll be spending a lot of time with this semester.
