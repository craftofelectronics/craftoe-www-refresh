## Announcements

Two announcements today:

1. With your permission, I would like to bump the exam back one day in the cycle due to the class cancellation. If there is *overwhelming agreement*, the exam will move to Monday, September 30th, with a review on the 23rd. If there is *substantial objection*, it will run on Wednesday, September 25th.

1. Please uninstall/delete your existing version of Alice. Then, [update to Alice 3.1.80](http://cs.berea.edu/files/Alice3Installer-Complete-3.1.80.0.0-windows.exe). We are still living with problems from the 3.1.66 era (because many of you are still using it). We have been advised by the authors of Alice3 that you should upgrade.

There are some USB sticks going around that have this new version of Alice3 on them. Work with those.

## More on Functions

Today, we're going to spend some more time systematically exploring the idea of a **function**.

Let's start with some definitions:

* A function may have zero or more inputs.

* A function may have zero or one outputs.

Let's start with something simple, like the **getHead** function.

First, we'll put Bob in a scene, and turn his head to the left.

<div class="text-center">
  <img src="{{site.base}}/images/functions/bob01.png" width="640">
</div>

When we run this code, we see Bob turn to the left half a revolution. 

Then, we can replace **this.Bob** with a function. In particular, we can use the function **getHead**. We would say the following:

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  The function <b>getHead</b> consumes an object in Alice, and returns an object in Alice.
</div>

This is some new language in more than one way.

* Things in Alice3 are, in computer science terms, **objects**. That's a technical term. The alien Bob is an object. His head is an object. So is his spine. (And his eyeballs, and everything else that Alice3 lets you select.) So, the object Bob is made up of many objects.

* Functions **consume** values. This is the terminology I'll use. That would be an input to the function. So, the function **getHead** takes one input, which is an Alice3 object. We assume it only works on objects that have heads.

* Functions **return** values. That is, if we look at the program as a whole, we can imagine that the innermost blocks get reduced/manipulated before the outer blocks. Therefore, our function **getHead** (or, **getSpineMiddle**, or whatever) has to be executed before the **turn** procedure. If we didn't execute **getHead** first, we'd have no idea what to turn! Therefore, we have to run the function, and see what comes back. We call what comes back the **return value**.

Here's a video that brings these things together:

## Writing your Own Procedures

When you write a function or a procedure, you're given a whole bunch of options. We'll start with a procedure (which is like a function, but it does not return anything). Let's look at how we might do that, one step at a time.

**Task**: I want Bob to shake his head **no**. To start, let's shake his head just once.

First, I'll write the code as part of the **firstMethod**.


<div class="text-center">
  <img src="{{site.base}}/images/functions/bob03.png" width="640">
</div>

Then, I'm going to create a procedure to hold these three commands. I'll call it **shakeHeadNo**.

You can watch the build process in this video.

* First I create a function. It consumes a **biped as a parameter**. This way, I can choose who I want to execute the action. I have to update the code to use this parameter.

* Then, I update the first method, so that I can see if it works.

* Then, I want to change how many times Bob shakes his head. So, I add another parameter. I use this to control the number of times I go through a loop.

* I test this.

* Next, I add a cat (her name is Fluffy). I give Fluffy some different parameters, and watch what happens when they both say "no."

* Then, I add another parameter, which lets me control how fast the head shakes (the duration). This way, Bob and Fluffy can both shake their head at different rates.

* Finally, I add in a rabbit (called Binkie - it is genderless). Again, I set the parameters for this procedure, and watch all three do their thing.

As you can see, the **shakeHeadNo** procedure lets me do the same action with many bipeds, but every time I use it, I get to change how it executes. **I make those changes by altering the parameters that are passed to the procedure**.

Here's a video that brings these things together:

## Writing Your Own Functions

What if I want to figure out something about the world, and use that information to help me do something? Then, I should use a **function** instead of a procedure.

**Task**: I want a function that consumes a Biped, and returns true if that Biped is taller than *this* Biped.

Now, that sounds confusing. However, we should **think in terms of objects**.

1. Who is *this*? If Bob is the Biped running the function, then he is *this*.

1. Who does Bob consume? Canonically, aliens eat cats (see below). However, we want Bob to be able to tell us if he is taller than any other Biped. So, we need a parameter that we can use to compare against.

Finally, we're asking a question, so we're going to use an **if statement** for the first time in this code.

The video below walks you through this process.
