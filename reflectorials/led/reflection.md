This is the start of a long journey, and reflecting on the work you do at every stage is a critical part of the learning process. You should have an electronics notebook, and you should be answering these questions in your notebook as you go.

<p>A critical part of your learning is recording things you don't understand... <i>yet</i>.</p>
<p>When you encounter things you don't understand, <b>record your questions in your notebook.</b> Then, you might ask those questions in the <i>Craft of Electronics</i> forum. In no small part, the <b>active process of questioning what you don't know</b> and <b>asking questions of others</b> is an essential part of learning.</p>

1. What kinds of errors did you encounter while programming the Arduino? Did you write them down, including the solutions that you came up with?

1. What questions did you come up with while you were building the circuit? 

1. What questions did you come up with while writing your program?

1. What role did the resistor play in the circuit?

1. The circuit diagram was presented to you using a tool called [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/). This is a free tool that makes it easy to draw circuits that look just like "the real thing." However, there's also a way of viewing circuits called a *schematic*. The Wikipedia has an article on a [simple LED schematic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LED_circuit). It makes for good reading. **Make notes about things you don't yet understand**.

1. What is the schematic symbol for an LED? ([Hint](http://bit.ly/18lwztQ))

1. What is the schematic symbol for a resistor?
