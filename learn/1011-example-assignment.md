We'll be doing a lot of reading and viewing of material out of class early on. It is likely that deeper understanding will come from iteration on the material. That means that we'll **read it** (and kinda understand), then **do it** (and understand better), then **revisit** the material (and hopefully get it better the second time around).

## Revisiting Reading

First, I recommend you [read my notes on reading]({{site.base}}/infra/how-to-read.html). You'll want to come back to this from time-to-time, and make sure you're being active in your reading process.

## Laying Foundations

First, read the [MGTE (Prolog and Chapter 1)](http://moodle2.berea.edu/course/view.php?id=2512#section-4). The prologue is "just for fun," and sets the stage for the text. The first chapter provides some background to the topic of electricity. 

This reading will lay conceptual foundations for the discussion of electricity and electronics. Take notes and come to class with questions.

## Moving Towards Making

Second, read Chapter 1 (through page 17) of **Make: Electronics**. This is a practical primer that will apply directly to our work on the first project.

## Then, Reflect

You should come to class prepared in several ways:

* [**Content**] Make sure you've developed an outline in your notebook regarding the structure of the material you've encountered so far. 

* [**Questions**] There are many kinds of questions. You might have **content and clarification questions**: there might be things you didn't understand or see the importance of as you watched and read. Or, you might have **conceptual questions**, where you're wondering how this material fits into other things you knew (or thought you knew). 

* [**Desire**] Hopefully, the video and reading will spark some interest; that is, there might be things that you know you want to spend time investigating further. What do you want from the course? What, of the topics discussed  look most interesting to you?

## And Submit

As an assignment (to be completed before **Sunday, 8PM**), I would like you to identify five questions that were particularly interesting/challenging for you as you engaged this material. In addition, where possible, identify resources you found online that were particularly useful in addressing any of the questions that you had. 

The due date is **Sunday, 8PM**. I will go through your answers before class on Monday, and use them to help frame some discussion.
