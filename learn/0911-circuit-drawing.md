You'll be doing two things for Wednesday.

## Drawing Circuits

For homework, I would like it if you would please draw a neat electrical circuit. Specifically, I would like you to draw the circuit that is in your quilt square.

1. You should use the correct symbols for a battery, LED, and resistor.
1. You should calculate the current in each wire using Ohm's Law.

Now, there's a bit of a trick to this.

1. Each "wire" in your circuit is made up of conductive thread. It has a resistance of 7{{site.ohm}}s per inch. So, when drawing your circuit, you need to draw your threads as a wire with a resistor in it. Estimate (somewhat accurately) how long each length of thread is in your square for this, so you get a reasonably accurate resistance value.

1. Each pin on the LilyTiny is capable of sourcing **up to** 40mA of current, and the device runs at 3V. When doing your calculations, you work with the voltage, and calculate the current required for your circuit based on the resistance. The 40mA represents a max that can be drawn from any given pin.

1. The LEDs you are using can be assumed to have a maximum current value of 25mA. More than that, and we expect they might either 1) have a limited lifetime or 2) burn out.

Draw a very neat circuit. Remember, that each thread will become a wire with a resistor, and that you need to label the current flowing through each part of your circuit.

## Exploring Arduinos

For Wednesday, do some Google and YouTube searching regarding the **Arduino**. This is a small computer that you are going to build and learn to program this term. (If that sentence made you panic, please... take a deep breath. You'll be fine.) And, it will live at the heart of your final project, which will involve building something that can:

* **Sense** the world around it,
* Do some **computation** on the values sensed, and 
* **Actuate**, or control, some kind of output.

But, before you commit yourself to a project, I think it's a good idea to do some looking around, and find out what kinds of projects have been undertaken by others. There's a lot out there on the WWW.

Good places to look for ideas:

* [Instructables](http://instructables.com/)
* [Make: Blog](http://blog.makezine.com/2012/12/28/best-of-arduino/)
* [The Arduino Playground](http://playground.arduino.cc/projects/ideas)
* [Make: Projects](http://makeprojects.com/c/Arduino)
* [Arduino Projects for Beginners](http://startingelectronics.com/beginners/start-electronics-now/tut10-ten-arduino-projects-for-absolute-beginners/)
* [Arduino Tutorials](http://www.arduinotutorials.com/)

Use these as starting points, and perhaps they will inspire additional searches that you can do. For example, you might see a project about putting an Arduino on a cat; this could inspire you to do more, specific Google searches regarding Arduino-controlled cats, or... something.

### Submit your Ideas

Submit your ideas to Moodle, so I can bring them up on the big screen, and we can take a look at them as a class. (*For the future, Prof. Matt: make sure you require them to include hyperlinks...*)
