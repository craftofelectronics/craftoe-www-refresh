There's some practical parts to this homework, some reading, some viewing.

## Practical

The practical portion follows on from your work on Wednesday. You'll want to finish the lab work from Wednesday if you haven't, and in addition, complete the following circuits.

1. Create a circuit where you have two pull-up circuits in parallel feeding the same pin. This way, no matter which one you press, the Arduino reports a successful button press.

1. Create a circuit where you have two pull-up circuits, one on each of two different pins. That is, you might have one button connected to pin 2, and one connected to pin 5. Modify your code so that it prints "Button Pressed on Pin 2" or "Button Pressed on Pin 5", depending on which button is pressed. (This is mostly a copy-paste operation, and you need to change one value in your code.)

Something I want to stress to you: most people that you know who are "good with computers" or good at programming <em>used to have no idea what they were doing</em>. However, they were unafraid to explore and try things. Even if you're new to programming, you should know that you have everything it takes to be successful at it. Just give it a try, screw things up, try and fix it, get frustrated, and, as need be, <strong>ask questions</strong>. It's all part of the process.

## Reading

**UPDATED, WEDNESDAY EVENING, OCT 9th**

You have **two** (not three) readings.

Read from the [Encyclopedia regarding DC motors](http://moodle2.berea.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=96406). This is loaded into Moodle. 

Then, read [Simon Monk's tutorial on using DC motors with the Arduino](http://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-lesson-13-dc-motors/overview). This is part of the Adafruit Learning System, a set of practical tutorials designed for beginners exploring electronics and the Arduino. We'll do this in class on Monday, as well as spend a bit more time practicing some programming.

(Removed: the reading on diodes.)

## Watch

Finally, watch the following videos. These will lay the foundation for what we'll review in class. I expect you to have questions; please bring them.

All of the videos can be found on [the archive page from last semester](http://craftofelectronics.org/archive/spring-2013/infra/programming-the-freeduino/).

### Videos 1 through 6

The first six videos are useful for the work we're doing as homework. They're reminders/review of things like **pinMode()** and friends. Watching them is a good idea. They're short (2-5 minutes), so fear not.
