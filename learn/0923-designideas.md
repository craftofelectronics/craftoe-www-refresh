For homework for Monday, September 23rd:

* Finish your Build (short)
* Review Batteries (short)
* A Project Plan (longer, but mostly short)

## Finish the Build

Many of you made excellent progress in class. I saw a lot of excellent soldering, and the few mistakes that were made provided an excellent opportunity to learn how to desolder and fix the kinds of errors that are typical in this game. **All around, excellent work**.

Finish the build, and Monday we'll test our Arduinos and start into "making them go."

## Review Batteries

You got out of a quiz on batteries today. Look back at the previous reading assignment, and refresh yourself on batteries. Thats the **MGtE Chapter 2** and the second half of **Make: Electronics Chapter 1**.

## Researching Your Brainstorms

You've come up with some brainstorms. Well, some of you have -- some of you failed to submit any brainstorms. This will put you at a disadvantage, but we proceed just the same.

## What is an Intro and a Plan?

Your project introduction provides an overview of the entire project. It tells us what you are going to do, and what you hope to learn. It is short, but clear, and sets your reader up for understanding the rest of the document.

Your project plan is a document that clearly details your thinking regarding how your project will progress. What makes this document important is that you question everything that you are going to do, and keep breaking it down until you are confident that you understand every single step you are going to take.

**You will be asked to revise this document based on feedback from me. So, do your best with it, but be comforted by the fact that we will come back to this again.**

## Introduction Requirements

Your project introduction provides an overview of the entire project. It tells us what you are going to do, and what you hope to learn. It is short, but clear, and sets your reader up for understanding the rest of the document. It should be **no more than a page**; be brief and clear.


## The Project Plan

It is hard to write a good project plan. I would like to show you two examples: a bad plan, and a good plan. I will demonstrate using a road trip to San Francisco as an example.

### A Bad Plan

We'll grab Matt's car, you can bring some food, and we'll take off for California. We'll be there in no time!

*(That was the whole plan. Some of you might like it. It makes for bad design and implementation practice, though, trust me.)*

### A Good Plan

The plan is broken into two sections: pre-departure and during the drive.

**Pre-Departure**

1. The car needs to be checked out; an oil change is probably a good idea, and right now there's a warning light on. We should either get a code reader (so we can check this regularly during the trip), or we can fix it. Matt thinks it is just an evap issue that has been unidentifiable/unfixable for over two years. It is a non-issue.

1. Christian will pack food for the first day of the trip. He'll also take responsibility for snacks (granola bars, etc.) that we might  want throughout the trip.

1. Ed will be responsible for planning the route. We should know what we will do, in terms of distance, each day. Each day should have a clearly known start and stop point. Although we have 2500 miles to go, we should probably plan on making reasonable drives each day, and perhaps seeing something cool here-and-there. For example, the [Black Canyon of The Gunnison](http://www.nps.gov/blca/index.htm) is close to our route; that might make a nice stop. 

**... without saying more, hopefully you get the idea**. A good plan is broken down until you are confident that you can execute every stage of the plan. Anywhere that you're uncertain, or lacking detail, will likely be a stumbling point in your project.

## Project Plan Requirements

Your plan needs to explore and explain several different aspects of your project, making it clear to your reader that you know what you are going to do, in detail, over the course of the next several weeks. It should have the following sections:

* Introduction
* Final Deliverable
* Project Roadmap (Schedule and Milestones)
* Resources Needed

### Final Deliverable

This is a concise statement regarding what you will deliver for your final project.

### Project Roadmap

You need a schedule and milestones.

#### Schedule

Your schedule should detail what work you will do each week, both in-class and out-of-class. At the least, you should identify what you intend to do each week, and how many hours of work you expect that part of the project will require. If you do not have a good idea of how to break something down, you should probably discuss it with your instructor, the TA, or even your classmates.

#### Milestones

Along the way, your project might hit one or more milestones. For example, finishing the circuit, or the program, or some other critical piece of your project will likely happen at one point or another. Identifying where those points are in your schedule are important, as they represent "mini-deliverables" along the way to a complete project.

### Resources Needed

Given that we do not have infinite resources in our lab, we will need to order some components before you can proceed. Therefore, the parts you need must be identified and ordered in before you can begin work.

To know what parts you might need implies you have a very clear idea of what circuit you will be building, what the final project will be enclosed with, etc. If you don't have a clear idea, and you need parts in the middle of March, you will loose a week of time (at least) while we order things that you are missing. You will not be given a "break" on your final project simply because you planned poorly. So, if you want to (for example) build a guitar effects pedal, you should know (up front) what capacitors, resistors, and other components you need to build your final project.

Ideally, you can also identify a source for these parts. [Adafruit](http://adafruit.com/), [Sparkfun](http://sparkfun.com/), [Jameco](http://jameco.com/), and [DigiKey](http://digikey.com/) are just a few possible places that you might find the parts that you need for your project.
