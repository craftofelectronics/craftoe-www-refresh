## Yay! TV!

All of the videos can be found on [the archive page from last semester](http://craftofelectronics.org/archive/spring-2013/infra/programming-the-freeduino/).

**NOTE!** Please, if there are topics you would like videos on, ask! I'll put one together.

### Videos 1 through 6

Again, the first six videos are useful review, if you need it. 

### Videos 7 and 8

You'll want to watch videos 7 and 8 before Wednesday, as they introduce new concepts.

Video 7 talks about *things in boxes*. Another name for these are *variables*. We'll spend some time with them in class, so fear not.

Video 8 talks about reading from sensors. We'll do this, too. In fact, this will serve as the basis for our Wednesday practical session.
