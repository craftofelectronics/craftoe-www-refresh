We'll be reading some new material (building our knowledge base), and prepping to use a new tool (so we don't maim ourselves horrifically).

Actually, the soldering iron is safer than the hot glue gun, so I'm just being dramatic. Fear not.

## Reading in **Make: Electronics**

Read pages 18 through 38. This is the remainder of Chapter 1. There will be a quiz over this material. You should make a particular focus of **batteries**. You may want to go back to **chapter two of the *Manga Guide***, and re-read some of that material as well.

We'll make a battery in class on Monday.

## Prepping to Solder

Watch the following videos, and complete a reflection document.

1. [How To Solder](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLfXXRfRIzY) <br/>
Although the video demonstrates wire splicing (a really useful skill, which I have in the past done **incorrectly**), it also demonstrates all the basics of soldering correctly. 5 minutes, and a must-watch.

1. [Through-Hole Soldering Tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYz5nIHH0iY) <br/>
This is *exactly* what you will be doing with your Freeduino. You need to watch the first 8 minutes of this video at the minimum. (The first 8 minutes cover how to do "through-hole" soldering correctly and what a bad solder connection looks like.) Minutes 9-11 show you how to bend components and place them, so that's also a good watch.

1. [N0SS Soldering Notes](http://www.elecraft.com/TechNotes/N0SS_SolderNotes/N0SS_SolderNotesV6.pdf) {{site.pdf}} <br/>
A concise textual guide to soldering, with nice diagrams throughout. This resources has been uploaded to Moodle.

If you find other resources online that you believe are valuable and/or high quality, please share them with {{site.prof-first}}.

### Objectives

1. Develop basic knowledge (but not experience) regarding how to solder through-hole components.

### Reflection and Rumination

In Word, create a document that reflects a step-by-step guide to soldering correctly. **You may use your notes on the quiz we will have at the start of class** (if they are printed and in hand), and {{site.ta-first}} and {{site.prof-first}} will look at these at the start of class to see if you are ready to begin working with the soldering iron.
