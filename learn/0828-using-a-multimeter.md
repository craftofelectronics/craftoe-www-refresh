The multimeter is one of the most important tools you'll use this term. It measures resistance, current, and a number of other electrical quantities. Multimeters come in many shapes and sizes; in class, we use the **Fluke 117**. 

## Watch First

First, watch this video on multimeters. In your note taking, do your best to identify the things that you think are important in terms of safe usage of a multimeter. Also, make notes regarding things that are mentioned but you don't fully understand the reason for.

## Read Second

After you've watched the video, and made notes (and noted questions!), read the Adafruit tutorial on multimeters.

This tutorial should 1) answer some of your existing questions, and 2) leave you with some new ones.


## What to Submit

Submit a Word document that answers the following questions. All submissions you make in this course (as well as any other, I suspect) should include your name and the date at the top of the document.

1. The Fluke 117 has a maximum safe voltage rating. What is that rating? 

1. The Fluke 117 is useful for measuring DC voltage in circuits like those we will build in this class. Is it safe to use it on AC voltages? For example, could we use it to test things while wiring a house? Why or why not?

1. Before using a multimeter, what steps could/should you take to make sure it is safe for you to use?

1. Your multimeter reads that an electrical outlet is off; your friend's multimeter reads that it is definitely live. How could you go about figuring out which of your multimeters is operating correctly?

1. Describe the symbol on the Fluke 117 that is used for continuity testing.

1. Describe the symbol on the Fluke 117 that is used for measuring DC voltage.

1. Describe the symbol on the Fluke 117 that is used for measuring resistance.

1. Which plugs should the black and red leads be connected to for continuity testing, DC voltage measurement, or to measure resistance? (They are all the same.)
