Bring to class (on paper, if you like) two critical aspects of your quilt square.

## Low-Fidelity Prototype

First, bring a low-fidelity prototype. 

You can work on this at home, or in the lab on Friday (from 10AM to noon), or Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Sunday evenings (7PM to 9PM). The lab has construction paper (if that is useful) and markers; please don't remove them from the lab. However, your prototype could be on plain white paper, and you could just write "blue" on pieces that are to be blue (for example).

Your prototype should be full size, and be complete enough that you can implement your design in felt from it. There should be no questions left in terms of implementation when you come in with your design. 

All you should need to do on Monday is:

* Cut out your felt
* Glue/sew the parts of your design
* Stitch in your circuit

You should not be doing creative design work when you come in on Monday.

### Remember

* The square is limited to 8" x 8", but you should make the square 9" x 9" so that we have room to attach between the squares.

* You are limited to four or five LEDs in your circuit; you should have at least two, that use two different pins on the LilyTiny.

## Circuit Diagram

</div>

Second, bring a circuit diagram for your square. It should indicate:

* Where the LilyTiny will go
* Where the battery will go
* The connections between the battery and the LilyTiny
* The connections between the LilyTiny and the LEDs.

### Remember

* The + on the battery goes to the + on the LilyTiny. This is your "power" line.
* The - on the battery goes to the - on the LilyTiny. This is "ground."
* The numbered pads on the LilyTiny go to the positive side of the LEDs. These pads tinkle and blink the LEDs.
* The ground side of the LED (or negative side) needs to connect to ground.

In most circuits that we build, there should only be *one* ground.
