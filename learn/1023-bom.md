Two things for Wednesday, neither terribly large.

## Bill of Materials

First, go through your project in detail, and figure out everything that you need.

Then, [add your parts to the BOM](
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlNxNvdJfUo8dFZvNVpXNDZUTUlrRF9IVzRRMkVwZnc&usp=sharing).

We'll look at these as a group on Wednesday.

## Continue with Light Sensor

Do your best to continue with the light sensor between now and Wednesday. We'll take a bit more time with it at the start of class; in particular, I want to take a few minutes to talk about "if" statements. (I'll try and do a video as well.)
