# WHAT! FINAL REPORT!

## The Final Report

The final report is outlined under the [resources section]({{site.base}}/infra/) of the course website. 

For Monday, draft the following sections:

* The Cover Page
* Introduction
* The Design section (only 2a)

This means that you'll try and write the text that motivates your project as well as what the big parts of your project are, and how they come together. Assume your reader is someone like yourself *before* they took CRAFToE. In other words, they're interested in the material, but they don't necessarily know jargon. 

## Expectations

This is a draft. Better to write more that contains errors (grammar, spelling) than to write less. It is easier to revise text later than to write new text. So, I'm looking for writing that does a good job of capturing the big picture, not perfect prose.
