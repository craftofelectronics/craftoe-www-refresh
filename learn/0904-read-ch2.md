First, don't forget about [my notes on reading]({{site.base}}/infra/how-to-read.html). 


Then, read [Chapter 2](http://moodle2.berea.edu/course/view.php?id=2512#section-4) of the MGTE. 

## Then, Reflect

You should come to class prepared in several ways:

* [**Content**] Make sure you've developed an outline in your notebook regarding the structure of the material you've encountered so far. 

* [**Questions**] There are many kinds of questions. You might have **content and clarification questions**: there might be things you didn't understand or see the importance of as you watched and read. Or, you might have **conceptual questions**, where you're wondering how this material fits into other things you knew (or thought you knew). 

## And Submit

Submit your questions to Moodle before class.
