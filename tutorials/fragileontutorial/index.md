In this tutorial, you'll learn to **turn on the LED built into your Arduino**. This involves learning:

1. How to use `pinMode()` to set the direction of a digital port on the Arduino---as either INPUT or OUTPUT.

1. How to use `digitalWrite()` to turn a port on.

1. A refresher on the "magic incantation" that every Arduino program must include for it to work: `setup()` and `loop()`.
