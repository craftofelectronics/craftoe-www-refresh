### Observe

Use your multimeter and some wire to recreate the experimental procedure demonstrated in the video.

### Purpose

To be comfortable working with the multimeter for testing continuity on a breadboard.

<!-- 
The video introduced you to the basics of breadboards and a multimeter (when used for checking continuity).

### Observe

Use your multimeter to check the continuity of at least ten to fifteen objects around you.

### Record

Record your observations for each of those objects. 

* What is the object you tested?

* What did the multimeter do?

### Hypothesize

We know that the multimeter, in continuity testing mode, tells us if there is a complete circuit from one probe to the other. 

1. For which objects did claim there was a good circuit? Were you surprised? Why or why not?

1. Which objects did it say there was no circuit? Were you surprised? Why or why not?

What is your theory as to why it works for some of these objects, but not for others?
