1. How could it be dangerous to you to check the continuity of a live circuit?

1. How could it be dangerous for the components if you were to check continuity on a live circuit?

1. What does the inside of a breadboard look like? Why, in a nutshell, does it work?

1. Are there limits to how much current can be passed through a breadboard? What are those limits?

1. A row on a breadboard is supposed to be electrically continuous. Sometimes it is not. What kinds of things could go wrong with a breadboard that would disrupt the continuity of a row or rail?

<!-- 
1. What is your theory as to what increases/limits the ability for the multimeter to detect whether there is electrical continuity between two points? What evidence do you have to support that theory?

    <b>Maintain a question list!</b> You should be writing down any and every question that you have, as they come to mind. Identifying questions is as important as learning new things, as they are an important part of engaging new material in an active way.
